# Project Introduction: UI Library Development

Welcome to the UI Library Development project! This document provides an overview of the project and its features to help you get started and understand the tools and technologies we are using.

## Overview

This project aims to build a comprehensive library of reusable UI components. By leveraging modern web development technologies and best practices, we aim to create a robust, efficient, and maintainable codebase.

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to build a comprehensive library of reusable UI components that can be used across various applications and projects. By creating a unified and consistent set of components, we aim to:

- **Enhance Development Efficiency**: By providing ready-to-use, well-documented components, developers can focus on building features rather than reinventing the wheel.
- **Ensure Consistency**: A shared component library ensures that all applications maintain a consistent look and feel, which improves the user experience and reinforces brand identity.
- **Improve Maintainability**: Centralizing components in one library makes it easier to maintain and update them. Bug fixes and improvements can be made in one place and propagate to all projects using the library.
- **Promote Best Practices**: By using modern technologies and adhering to best practices, we ensure that the components are high quality, performant, and scalable.

## Features

### ‚öõÔ∏è [React 18](https://reactjs.org/)

React is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. With React 18, we are utilizing the latest features and improvements to ensure a seamless and efficient development experience.

### üìö [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/)

Storybook is a powerful tool for developing UI components in isolation. It provides an interactive environment where you can visualize different states of your components and create comprehensive documentation.

### üñåÔ∏è [Tailwind CSS 3](https://tailwindcss.com/)

Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that allows you to build custom designs directly in your markup. With Tailwind CSS 3, we can quickly and efficiently style our components with ease.

### ‚è© [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)

Vite is a next-generation frontend tooling that provides an extremely fast development environment. It offers instant hot module replacement (HMR) and lightning-fast builds, significantly improving our development workflow.

### ‚ö° [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/)

Vitest is a blazing-fast unit testing framework tailored for Vite projects. It allows us to write and run tests efficiently, ensuring our components work as expected and maintain high quality.

### üìê [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) & [Prettier](https://prettier.io/)

ESLint and Prettier are essential tools for maintaining code quality and consistency. ESLint helps identify and fix potential issues in our code, while Prettier ensures our codebase follows a consistent style.

### üåü [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)

TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript that helps catch errors early through static type checking. It enhances the development experience by providing robust type definitions and improved code navigation.

### üê∂ [Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky) & [Lint Staged](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lint-staged)

Husky and Lint Staged are tools for managing pre-commit hooks. They ensure that our code meets quality standards before it gets committed, preventing potential issues from entering the codebase.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

2. **Start the development server**:

   ```bash
   pnpm run dev
   ```

3. **Build Lib**:

   ```bash
   pnpm run build:lib
   ```

4. **Run tests**:

   ```bash
   pnpm run test
   ```

## Conclusion

This project leverages modern tools and technologies to create a high-quality UI library. With React, Storybook, Tailwind CSS, Vite, Vitest, ESLint, Prettier, TypeScript, Husky, and Lint Staged, we aim to provide a seamless development experience and build a robust, maintainable codebase.

Feel free to explore the codebase, contribute, and provide feedback to help us improve the project. Happy coding!
